        <h4>Act II describes a conversation between the father Orgon and the daughter Mariane regarding Mariane's
            marriage.</h4>
        <p>
        <h5>ORGON:</h5>
        <p>Mariane.</p>
        <h5>MARIANE:</h5>
        <p>Yes.</p>
        <h5>ORGON:</h5>
        <p>Come here. We need to speak privately.</p>
        <h5>MARIANE:</h5>
        <p>Father, what is it you seek?</p>
        <h5>ORGON</h5>
        <p>[looking in the closet]:</p>
        <p> I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us. This is a perfect place for such a purpose. There now, it's okay.
            Mariane, I find
            You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind and you have always been most dear to me.</p>
        <h5>MARIANE:</h5>
        <p>A father's love brings true felicity.</p>
        <h5>ORGON:</h5>
        <p>Well said, my child! And to earn it fully you should devote yourself to contenting me.</p>
        <h5>MARIANE:</h5>
        <p>That's how my devotion is put to the proof.</p>
        <h5>ORGON:</h5>
        <p>Good. Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?</p>
        <h5>MARIANE:</h5>
        <p>Who me?</p>
        <h5>ORGON:</h5>
        <p>You. Think well before you reply.</p>
        <h5>MARIANE:</h5>
        <p>Oh my! Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.</p>

        <p>[Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen.]</p>

        <h5>ORGON:</h5>
        <p>That's sensibly spoken. Now tell me, girl,
            that his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,
            that he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice
            to have him be your husband by my choice.</p>
        <p>Eh?</p>
        </p>
