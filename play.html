    <h4>Act II describes a conversation between the father Orgon and the daughter Mariane regarding Mariane's marriage.</h4>
    <p>
        ORGON:  Mariane.<br>
        MARIANE:          Yes.<br>
        ORGON:                  Come here.  We need to speak privately.<br>
        MARIANE:        Father, what is it you seek?<br>
        ORGON [looking in the closet]: I'm seeing if anyone can overhear us. This is a perfect place for such a purpose. There now, it's okay.  Mariane, I find
        You endowed with a heart that's sweet and kind and you have always been most dear to me.<br>
        MARIANE:  A father's love brings true felicity.<br>
        ORGON:  Well said, my child!  And to earn it fully you should devote yourself to contenting me.<br>
        MARIANE:  That's how my devotion is put to the proof.<br>
        ORGON:  Good.  Now what do you think of our guest, Tartuffe?<br>
        MARIANE:  Who me?<br>
        ORGON:                 You.  Think well before you reply.<br>
        MARIANE:  Oh my!  Tell me what to say . . . and I'll comply.<br>

        [Dorine enters quietly and hides herself behind Orgon without being seen.]<br>

        ORGON:  That's sensibly spoken.  Now tell me, girl,
        that his merit shines like a gleaming pearl,
        that he warms your heart, and that you would rejoice
        to have him be your husband by my choice.<br>
        Eh?<br>
